/**
 * Rainbow admin portal
 * # Rainbow administrator portal API guide  ## Preamble  ### Introduction  This guide describes list of API services that are provided by OT Rainbow management portal system. Services are used to manage OT Rainbow system entities  ### Protocol  REST interface is used for sending/receiving OT rainbow API messages. HTTP requests GET, DELETE, POST, UPDATE are used. Standard HTTP responses are used to provide requested information or error status. There is no session notion in OT Rainbow system, so requests could be issued according stateless model, without transport conservation between them. Additional data could be provided in message body. JSON is used as a main format for data encoding in message body part. Each request is started with the following pattern /{module}/{version}/ where {module} is a portal module name to address and {version} is a version of used API, par example, “v1.0”.  ### Security considerations  Each request should contain some credential information to authenticate itself. Standard HTTP authentication with basic/bearer modes is used. JSON Web Token mechanism is used to provide authentication information. JWT has a expire timeout that is controlled by OT Rainbow portal to prevent very long token usage. Also authentication with application token is used. The token must be provided in the request HTTP header, using a custom header: APIKey. At server side, token is verified, and if it doesn’t match, 403 Not Allowed response is sent. TLS is used as a transport protocol to support message exchanges between OT Rainbow portal and an application.

    /**
     * Get all users
     * This API allows administrators to list users.       Users with &#x60;superadmin&#x60;, &#x60;support&#x60; role can retrieve users from any company.    Users with &#x60;support&#x60; role can retrieve lastLoginIOSDate and lastLoginAndroidDate providing format option &#x60;full&#x60;.       Users with &#x60;bp_admin&#x60; or &#x60;bp_finance&#x60; role retrieve only users from company being End Customers of their BP company (i.e. all the companies having bpId equal to their companyId).       Users with &#x60;admin&#x60; role retrieve only users belonging to companies they can manage. That is to say:   * an organization_admin gets all users belonging to each companies he manages (i.e. companies having organisationId equal to his organisationId) * a company_admin gets all users being in his company * a site_admin gets all users being in his company     Note:   * To hide GUEST, the filter roles&#x3D;user is applied by default. Then all multi-roles like &#x60;admin&#x60;, &#x60;bp_admin&#x60; or &#x60;bp_finance&#x60; stay retrievable. To get only guest belonging to a company, use GET /api/rainbow/admin/v1.0/users?roles&#x3D;guest     This API can return more or less user information using format option in query string arguments (default is small).    This API implement pagination, using limit and offset options in query string arguments (default is limit on 100 users). Result sorting can also be done using sort and order options (default is sort on displayName on ascending order).       This API allows to filter results on several criterion by providing appropriate options in query string arguments (displayName, companyName, loginEmail, jid_im, jid_tel, companyId).       Examples:   * basic: GET https://openrainbow.com/api/rainbow/admin/v1.0/users * with format options: GET https://openrainbow.com/api/rainbow/admin/v1.0/users?format&#x3D;full * with pagination options: GET https://openrainbow.com/api/rainbow/admin/v1.0/users?limit&#x3D;10&amp;offset&#x3D;20&amp;sortField&#x3D;loginEmail&amp;sortOrder&#x3D;-1 * with filter options: GET https://openrainbow.com/api/rainbow/admin/v1.0/users?displayName&#x3D;john doe&amp;companyId&#x3D;56d6f0d441255dd54b5b61b3 56b89d26f7ab94c69ad41584  
     * @param {String} accept application/json
     * @param {Object} opts Optional parameters
     * @param {String} opts.searchEmail Allows to filter users list on the loginEmail field using the word provided in this option.
     * @param {String} opts.companyId Allows to filter users list on the companyIds provided in this option.       In the case of &#x60;admin&#x60; (without superadmin, support roles), provided companyIds should correspond to companies visible by logged in user&#39;s company (if some of the provided companyId are not visible by logged in user&#39;s company, users from these companies will not be returned).
     * @param {String} opts.roles Allows to filter users list on the role(s) provided in this option.       This allow for example to get all users with role bp_admin.    By default, only users having (at least) the role &#x60;user&#x60; are listed.
     * @param {String} opts.isTerminated Allows to filter users list on the status &#39;isTerminated&#39;.       By default, terminated users are not listed.
     * @param {String} opts.format Allows to retrieve more or less user details in response.    - &#x60;small&#x60;: id, loginEmail, firstName, lastName, displayName, companyId, companyName, isTerminated    - &#x60;medium&#x60;: id, loginEmail, firstName, lastName, displayName, jid_im, jid_tel, companyId, companyName, lastUpdateDate, lastAvatarUpdateDate, isTerminated, guestMode    - &#x60;full&#x60;: all user fields
     * @param {Number} opts.limit Allow to specify the number of users to retrieve.
     * @param {Number} opts.offset Allow to specify the position of first user to retrieve (first user if not specified). Warning: if offset &gt; total, no results are returned.
     * @param {String} opts.sortField Sort user list based on the given field.
     * @param {Number} opts.sortOrder Specify order when sorting user list.
     * @param {String} opts.displayName Allows to filter users list on the given keyword(s) on field displayName.
     * @param {Boolean} opts.useEmails used with displayName, allows to filter users list on the given keyword(s) on field displayName for loginEmails too.
